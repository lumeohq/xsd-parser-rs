# xsd-parser-rs
An xsd/wsdl => rust code generator written in rust. The main target is for generation of the [ONVIF Specifications](https://www.onvif.org/) but should work for other SOAP/XSDL/WSDL needs.

## XSD types mapping

A following mapping used to represent built-in XSD types as rust types:

Notes:

(1) we are using our own big integer types, that wrap `num_bigint::BigInt` and `num_bigint::BigUint`
and provide XML (de)serialization with `yaserde`. You can find `Integer`, `NonNegativeInteger`,
`PositiveInteger`, `NonPositiveInteger` and `NegativeInteger` in the corresponding files within
`xsd-types/src/types/`

(2) we are using our own type `Decimal`, which wraps `bigdecimal::BigDecimal` and provides 
XML (de)serialization with `yaserde`. You can find `Decimal` in `xsd-types/src/types/decimal.rs`

(3) we are using our own time types, that wrap types from `chrono` crate and provide
XML (de)serialization with `yaserde`. You can find `Date`, `Time`, `DateTime` and `DateTimeStamp`
in the corresponding files within `xsd-types/src/types/`. Since `chrono` has it flaws and does not
follow ISO 8601 strictly, we use self-implemented parsing and might replace `chrono` in the future.
Feel free to suggest an appropriate crate for time handling.

(4) we are using our own type `Duration`, since there is no known implementation
in rust that supports proper month/years holding and literal representation. You can find
`Duration` in `xsd-types/src/types/duration.rs`

(5) we are using our own gregorian calendar types, that provide XML (de)serialization with `yaserde`
following ISO 8601 strictly. You can find `gDay`, `gMonth`, `gMonthDay`, `gYear` and `gYearMonth`
in the corresponding files within `xsd-types/src/types/`.

## `any` elements handling

There are cases when schema allows extensions for the certain type.

```xml
<xs:complexType name="MyType">
    <xs:sequence>
        <xs:element name="Parameters" type="xs:string" />
        <xs:any namespace="##any" processContents="lax" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
    </xs:sequence>
    <xs:anyAttribute namespace="##any" processContents="lax"/>
</xs:complexType>
```

In such cases we don't know in advance what fields must be present in Rust struct so we don't add them to output:

```rust
#[derive(Default, PartialEq, Debug, YaSerialize, YaDeserialize)]
#[yaserde(prefix = "tns", namespace = "tns: http://example.com")]
pub struct MyType {
    #[yaserde(prefix = "tns", rename = "Parameters")]
    pub parameters: String,
}
```

In this unlucky situation to support extensions user can either:
- modify the generated code and add extension fields manually
- modify source XSD and add extension elements there
